From the team's side I expect the _vast majority_ of the code to be done and in the `main` branch of the repo by the time we meet for the next team lead meeting. Please prune branches that are not in active use (ie say no commits in two weeks)\n2. There will be an official code freeze sometime, likely Week 10 Saturday (not confirmed yet, waiting on the Prof and other TA's to confirm) post which the only commits allowed would be video submissions.\n3. Please update your `readme.md` with details about your project, it should include a link to your deployment if it's a website and installers in the releases if it's an electron application.\n4. Ensure you're planning to wrap up all assignments by the end of next week (and preferably wrap up everything but the second sprint related stuff by the time I meet the team leads, especially the CI\/CD part two, the ADRs, etc). We will brief you on the specifics if we're creating gradescope submissions for the project or no.\n5. I will be taking final interviews with your teams likely either later this week(unlikely) or next week (more likely). The details are yet to be finalized but likely going to be on:\n    a. What you did\n    b. What you think others did\n    c. Why certain decisions were made in the project\n    d. You need to have some high level idea of the project ie \"I was on the backend team, I dont know what CI is\" would be a negative, and you'd have to elaborate on how this doesn't worsen your team's bus factor\n6. Typically these interviews last around 5 minutes and will be holding 1:1s with everyone in your teams individually. These will be on zoom and timings will be announced later.\n7. Final interviews can have a major impact on your _individual_ project grade - as TAs we have many signals about your performance including but not limited to feedback forms, commits in the repo, participation, etc. Those along with the with the final interview let us get a deep insight into what your contributions were to the project. For example, it is possible to be on a underperforming team and get an A or be on the best team and get a B-.",
