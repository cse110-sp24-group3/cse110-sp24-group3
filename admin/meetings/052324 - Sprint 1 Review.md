These notes don't encapsulate everything from the meeting or what needs to be done, check the projects tab!
Rei

- 3 dot icon now has a popup window with options to download or delete
- Mentions the implementation of another option in popup windown called "Dev Mode"
- Jesus mentioned a css task to hide the gray background of entry and display it on hover to more distinctly display where the user is at
- Went over all the issue categories to elaborate tasks
- second validation when deleting or canceling changes

Cameron
- saving data
- lots of groups using localstorage to save data but its not the best solution
  - local storage can be capped out for a certain entry
  - what happens if the browsers cleared or how can I get it easily?
- soltion is to store down all the markdown files in the directory
- anytime we create a new journal there will be a new folder/directiory within the aplication folder which will contain all the entries where the entries will be the markdown file this is a more simple solution but will be harder to implement
- implementation of this will be in a JS doc and diagram to show info and what we can do with this

- brainstorm: 
  - replace the "download markdown" button with a export button
