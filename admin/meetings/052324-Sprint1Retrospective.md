### Ideas to better our sprints :

- Standup bots
- More issue deligation
- Utilize story points
  - helps with time management
  - split poeple in components and pick/assign an equal amount of work
  - TA told us to avoid story points but we will still consider the perspective of picking what we want during planning

### Ideas to reference from : 

- We didn't group based off preference but component for the issues
- Instead of asking people in a binary way, we can implement a google form of a priority list of what we want to do

### Ideas that worked well :

- Meeting inperson to plan out together
- Help provide more insight for each individual attendee

### TA comments :

- we are doing well with overall aspects of the project
- biggest takeaway was distribution of output
