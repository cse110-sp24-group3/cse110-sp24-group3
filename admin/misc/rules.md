## Team Working Agreement
*Spring 2024*  
*Creation Date: 04/16/2024*

### 2) Primary Means of Communication and Expectations
- **Slack**: We'll use Slack for all our team conversations. Please respond to any relevant messages within a 24-hour window. Let's keep the communication timely to ensure smooth progress.

### 3) Scheduling Meetings
- **Regular Meetings**: We’ll have regular meetings to keep everyone aligned. These are set at a specific cadence and attendance is crucial. Mark your calendars!
- **Ad-hoc Meetings**: Sometimes we’ll need to gather outside our regular times especially when we’re pushing deadlines or tackling big issues. We’ll agree on these times at the end of each meeting making sure everyone can make it.
- **Reminders and Agendas**: Whichever team member is hosting will send out a reminder along with the agenda at least 24 hours before our meeting. This helps us all come prepared and make the most of our time together.
- **Can’t Make It?** If you can’t attend a meeting let a team lead know at least 24 hours in advance. This gives us enough time to adjust plans or fill you in later. Your involvement matters so keep us in the loop!
- **Rescheduling**: If we see that too many team members can’t make it we’ll find a new time that suits everyone. Flexibility is key to keeping everyone engaged and informed.

### 4) General Responsibilities for All Team Members
- **Respect**: Treat each other with respect at all times. Value each other's ideas and contributions and maintain a professional demeanor in all interactions.
- **Communication**: Keep communication frequent and transparent across all channels including Slack and email. If you're facing challenges inform the team promptly.
- **Commitment**: Adhere to deadlines and prepare adequately for meetings. Complete your assigned tasks responsibly and maintain engagement with the team's objectives.
- **Flexibility**: Be open to changes and adjustments in our plans or strategies as necessary. Adaptability is crucial for navigating project shifts effectively.
- **Accountability**: Take responsibility for your contributions to the project. If issues arise focus on solutions and learning from the experience rather than assigning blame.
- **Positive Attitude**: Maintain a constructive attitude towards work. Support your teammates and acknowledge both small and significant achievements.
- **Feedback**: Offer and receive feedback in a constructive manner. Use feedback as a tool for personal and team growth.
- **Confidentiality and Integrity**: Handle all team information and data with care ensuring confidentiality and integrity at all times.

### 5) Conflict Resolution
- **Addressing Issues Internally**: When a team member fails to meet deadlines or other responsibilities, the team will first address the issue internally. We will schedule a meeting with the involved parties to discuss the situation openly and constructively. The goal is to understand the root of the problem and collaboratively develop a solution.
- **Action Steps**: During the meeting, we will:
  - Allow the team member to explain any obstacles they are facing.
  - Offer support or resources that might help overcome these challenges.
  - Agree on a realistic plan and timeframe for remedying the situation.
- **Follow-Up**: We will set a follow-up meeting to assess progress and ensure that the agreed-upon actions are being taken. This approach aims to resolve issues quickly and amicably, maintaining the team’s overall productivity and cohesion.
- **Escalation**: If the internal resolution does not lead to improvement or if the issue recurs, it will then be appropriate to bring the matter to a TA or professor for further guidance.

### 6) Expectations of Faculty and GTA’s
- If a team member fails to live up to this agreement, the situation may be reported to the staff, but the team will still be responsible for submitting a completed assignment. Staff will be available to meet with teams to resolve issues.
