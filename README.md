## Git Commit and Branch Rules

### Commit Message Guidelines

When committing changes to the repository, use the following prefixes to categorize your work, followed by a short descriptive message. If necessary, you may include a brief paragraph (2-3 sentences) to provide additional context about the changes.

- **feat**: New feature addition
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **docs**: Changes to documentation
- **style**: Formatting, linting, and similar non-code changes
- **refactor**: Code restructuring without changing external behavior
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **chore**: Routine maintenance tasks
- **init**: Initial commit of new files or projects
- **rearrange**: Files moved, added, or deleted
- **update**: Updates to code (e.g., versions, library compatibility)

#### Example Commit Message
```
chore: remove .DS_Store

Removed the .DS_Store files that were accidentally committed in previous commits, to clean up the repository and maintain a more professional codebase.
```

### Branch Naming Conventions

Create new branches for each piece of work, using names that provide a clear, short description of the work without including the type prefix. This approach ensures branches are straightforward and focused on specific tasks or features.

#### Example Branch Names
- `login-system`: Branch for implementing the login system.
- `memory-leak-fix`: Branch dedicated to fixing a memory leak issue.
- `update-readme`: Branch for updating the README documentation.
- `code-formatting`: Branch for applying code formatting rules.

Ensure that your branch names are descriptive, concise, and relevant to the changes you are making. This will facilitate better understanding and communication among team members.
